    <h3 style="padding-top: 1%; text-align: center">How does this work?</h3>

    <p style="text-align: center; margin: 0 5% 0 5%">This program is aimed to send the student text messages and/or emails regarding upcoming due dates for a class. You will be able to pick the classes you want to get alerted for and have the option to pick anywhere from 1-7 days to be notified. And the best part, its free</p>
    
    <div style="background-color: #5fdf95">
    <h3 style="padding-top: 2.5%; text-align: center">How do you receive alerts for a class?</h3>
    </div>
    <p style="text-align: center; margin: 0 5% 0 5%">First, someone, whether is it an instructor or another student must upload the alerts for their class using their syllabus given in class. If the alerts for the class are already uploaded, you may click on Receive Alerts at the top of the page and look for your class by entering the instructor's last name and class name(Ex. ENG 101). Click on the link that appears in the search results and you will be directed to a page where you can put in your phone number and/ or email. Once thats done, sit back and relax and never forget a due date ever again</p>
    
     <div style="background-color: #5fdf80">
    <h3 style="padding-top: 2.5%; text-align: center">How do you create alerts for a class?</h3>
    </div>
    <p style="text-align: center; margin: 0 5% 0 5%">Anyone from an instructor to a homeless person can create alerts for a class. Just have the syllabus for the class with all the assignments and due dates and go to Create Alerts at the top of the page. Click on it and you will be asked to log in using either your phone number or email.

Once you're done filling out all the fields, click the upload button and everyone in that class can receive alerts</p>
