Hey everyone,

Having difficulty coding up that pesky page Navigation that will organize the search results on your page? Go towards pageNavm.php and simply use my pageNav class to sort it. 

Simply read the instructions and assure that your CSS adheres to what is called in the functions.

Input is welcome!
